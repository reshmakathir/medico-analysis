Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing healthcare-related data from multiple monthly datasets (April, May, June). Utilized Power Query to automate data extraction through a custom function, merging monthly tables into a unified dataset using Table.Combine. Performed data cleaning, transformation, and standardization of column formats to ensure accuracy and consistency. Designed intuitive visualizations to track key metrics, trends, and comparisons across months, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify changes and patterns in the data.

Key Contributions:

Automated combination of multi-month data into a single dynamic dataset.

Applied advanced Power Query transformations to remove redundant filtering steps and retain all relevant records.

Built interactive visuals with slicers for date range and category selection.
